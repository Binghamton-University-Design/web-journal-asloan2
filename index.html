					<h2>Project 4: 
						Infographic Timeline 
					</h2>
					<p><img id="dbcooper1" src=images/dbcooper1.png></p>
					<p>I was really excited about this project. I wanted to do something that was unique and in a shorter span of time. In my spare time, I sometimes enjoy watching documentaries on unsolved mysteries, otherwise known as cold cases. One of my favorite cold cases is that of D.B. Cooper.

					<h2>Project 3: 
						Editorial 
					The environmental costs of fast fashion</h2>
					<p><img id="fashion" src=images/fastfashion.png></p>
					<p>With the rise in environmental awareness, I wanted to create a piece that would speak out on what has been happening. The article I read up on spoke about how fast fashion was not creating millions of pounds of textile waste and polluting water, but also burning down forrests.

					<h2>Project 3: 
						Editorial 
					Reflections on the gender inclusive Siddur</h2>
					<p><img id="siddur" src=images/siddur.png></p>
					<p>I don't feel that I have been too connected to my religion, but over the last year I have been investing more and more time into studying my Jewish Heritage and learning about my culture and myself. I wanted to create a piece on something I was passionate about, so I decided to take an article from the feminist Jewish Magazine "Lilith", which I had written a whole paper on last year.

					<h2>Project 3: 
						Editorial 
					Binghamton's first vegan restaurant comes to Clinton Street</h2>
					<p><img id="vegan" src=images/veganplace.png></p>
					<p>This article is written by Binghamton's student-run newspaper, Pipe Dream. I have been creating artwork for Pipe Dream for three years and wanted to use one of their articles for part of this assignment.

					<h2>Project 2:  Personal Icon</h2>
					<p><img id="icons" src= "images/artboard2.png"></p>
					<h2>Project 2:  Process</h2>
					<p><img id="process" src= "images/process.png"></p>
					<p>Here I created three icons I felt best represented myself using multiple elements in a cohesive way. I wanted all of the colors to be connected, so I used two different types of purples that I felt best represented me. The pizza, the dog, and the Hamsa all represent different parts of myself. I first sketched in my notebook and I rendered these sketches in illustrator.

					<h2>Project 1: 
						Avatar</h2>
					<p><img id="avatar" src=images/annabethbeach.png></p>
					<p>My first assignment was to create an avatar from an isometric grid. My drawings are usually stylistic and I decided to incorporate that into my vector art. I put my avatar in one of my favorite places: a beach in New Jersey.
